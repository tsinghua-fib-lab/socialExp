# Social Experiment Framework (Anonymous Repository)
Submission to ACL: Exploring Large Language Model Agents for Piloting Social Experiments

This repository contains implementation code for three distinct social experiment simulations using LLM-powered agents. All experiments are structured to ensure reproducibility while maintaining anonymity requirements.

## Experiment Modules

### polarization/ 
Contains code and dependencies for "Gun Control Policy" polarization simulation experiments. 

### UBI/
Implements Universal Basic Income (UBI) policy simulation experiments. 

### hurricane/
Implements simulation experiments for the impact of hurricane.
